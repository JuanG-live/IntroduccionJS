# 🚀 React + TypeScript: The Complete Guide with 10+ Projects

Welcome to my journey through the course **"React and TypeScript – The Complete Guide Building 10+ Real Projects"**.

This repository documents my personal progress, notes, and reference code while going through every concept in the course. All the **projects** created during the course will be organized in **separate repositories** for clarity and scalability. This one is focused on the **core concepts, fundamentals, and ESNext features** covered in the first section of the course.

## 📚 Course Overview

The course covers both foundational and advanced topics in the React ecosystem, fully typed with **TypeScript** and includes integration with modern tools and full-stack setups like **MERN**, **PERN**, and **Next.js 14**.

You’ll work with:

- ✅ React + TypeScript from scratch
- ⚡️ Advanced State Management: `Zustand`, `useReducer`, `Context API`
- 📦 Form handling: `React Hook Form`, `Zod`
- 🌐 APIs: `Fetch`, `Async/Await`, `React Query`
- 💄 Styling: `TailwindCSS`, `Headless UI`
- 🔀 Routing: `React Router DOM`, `Next.js App Router`
- 🧩 Fullstack: `MongoDB`, `PostgreSQL`, `Node.js`, `Express`, `Prisma`
